## Sperm Methylation Array EDA

Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of Chinese Han male semen samples. The Illumina Human Methylation 450 Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. Samples included 3 young males (aged 24, 25 and 25 years old) and 3 aged males (aged 63, 60 and 55 years old).
